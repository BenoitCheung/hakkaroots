					<p>My Hakka name is Zong Koi-Yaw (<span class="cc">张开耀</span>) and this is my website. I created it with two main goals in mind. One of them was to learn to create webpages, the other one was to store some of the informations I got from my research about the Hakka people and about my ancestors. I wish you a good time browsing and I hope I can help you learn something new today. I will try to make updates as I learn more about webcoding and about the topics covered here.</p>
					<p>I'm not an expert and everything I talk about here is actually pretty new to me. There might be some mistakes, I still have a lot to learn and a lot of room for improvement so feel free to contact me to give me your feedback. You will find how to contact me <a href=#>here</a> or in the bottom section.

		<h2 class="sectiontitle">Hakka 客家</h2>
		<h3 class="chinesequote"><span class="cc">「有阳光的地方就有华人，有华人的地方就有客家人」</span></h3>
		<p class="citation">"Wherever the sun shines, there are Chinese people. Wherever there are Chinese people, there are Hakka people."</p>
			<h3 class="sectionsub">Who are they ?</h3>
				<p>The Hakka are an ethnic subgroup of the Han Chinese. They mainly come from Southern China provinces: Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Sichuan and also Taiwan. They differ from the other chinese subgroups by their name: Hakka or Kèjiā litteraly means "guest families". Whereas other ethnics groups are most commonly named after a location, usually after their province. We will explain this name later in the next section. </p>
				<p>Hakka people speak the Hakka fa or Kèjiā huà <span class="cc">客家话</span> and it has a lot of phonological variants. A very clear difference can be noted between this dialect and other local dialects spoken by the neighboring populations of the Hakkas, such as cantonese or minnan for example. The Hakka language is spoken by more than 48 million native speakers and is the 5th most spoken chinese dialect in the world. It is also recognized as one of the official languages of Taiwan. </p>
				<p>Some historians claim that the Hakka dialect is one of the most ancient form of chinese language still used today, and that the Hakka people are arguably the true heirs of the Han culture: the rest of the Han chinese who stayed in the North have been invaded and culturaly assimilated by the Five Barbarians, unlike the Hakka who went south.</p>
				<p>Hakkas are found wherever there is a Chinese diaspora, but the majority of overseas Hakkas reside in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore). But they can also be found in Africa (South Africa, Mauritius, Réunion), in Americas (USA, Canada, Jamaica, Suriname), in Oceania (Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti), or even in Europe (UK, France, Netherlands). In short, hakkas are found all around the globe.</p>
			<h3 class="sectionsub">L'Histoire des Hakkas</h3>
				<h3 class="sectionsub">Hakka History</h3>
				<p>Hakka's origins remain obscure. Historians tend to agree that Hakka's ancestors migrated from more northern provinces around the Yellow River, ancestral geopolitical center of China, such as Henan and Hubei. We can list five main historical migration waves: </p>
			<div class="flex">
				<div class="img_wrap migration">

				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>From the 4th century, during the Jin dynasty, the ancestors of the Hakkas have migrated southwards because of the invasion of the "Five barbarians" <span class="cc">五胡乱华</span>.</li>
					<li>During the 10th century, because of the instability caused by the Huang Chao uprising and the fall of the Tang dynasty.</li>
					<li>During the 12th and 13th century, between the Song and Yuan dynasty, especially after the fall of the Song capital of Bianliang by the Jurchen people from the North.</li>
					<li>In late 17th century, during the Qing dynasty,  the remnants of the last Ming dynasty flew to Taiwan so the Kangxi Emperor gave the order to evacuate the southern littoral for almost 10 years. After the threat had been dealt with, people could repopulate these areas.</li>
					<li>Between the 19th and 20th century, the Taiping Rebellion and the Hakka-Punti wars have caused some Hakkas to flee overseas, alongside other reasons we'll discuss below.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
				<p>These tales of migration are the founding of the Hakka identity, and are passed down from generation to generation. The Hakkas have been frequently subjected to hatred and discrimination by other Chinese local groups. These would go from simple verbal insults to mass-killing and genocide The name "Hakka" is actually the cantonese pronunciation of <span class="cc">客家</span> which means "Guest families", which was basically an insult. The most tragic example is probably the Punti-Hakka wars. During the Red Turban Rebellion in Guangdong, after multiple generations of animosities between Hakkas and Punti (= locals, in this case Cantonese people), the imperial army's raids on villages began a cascade of hateful events between the two clans. Between 1855 and 1867, they raised armies to battle each other. More than 500,000 people perished and thousands of villages were destroyed. Some of these conflicts were repeated in various chinese diasporas around the world.</p>
				<p>The strong identity of the Hakkas is based on their experience of having to struggle to live in overpopulated regions, by hostile groups or in mountainous and unwelcoming areas. They often had to settle for less desirable lands as their neighbors'. Most of them were farmers and worked hard because the soil was much less fertile. Hakka farmers were notorious for being able to farm any land no matter how high up they had to farm. That situation imposed hard work, toughness, dedication, perseverance, quick adaptability, frugality and a great sense of community. </p>
				<p>Education was also a Hakka priority. Many Hakka scholars performed well enough in the civil service exams to go on to careers in the government.</p>
			<h3 class="sectionsub">La culture Hakka</h3>
				<p>These values stated earlier reflect in different cultural areas:</p>
			<div class="flex">
				<ul>
					<li>Architecture: the Hakka houses are fortified buildings housing many families. They have a circular or rectangular shape and usually a single entrance. On the ground floor are the animals and the altar. The attic and weapon reserves were located on the first floor. The dwellings were on the second floor. The most famous example is the Tulou <span class="cc">土楼</span> "earth building" of Fujian, inscribed by UNESCO on the World Heritage List in 2008. Many of the Hakka houses are still inhabited today.</li>
					<li>Genealogy: Similarly to other Han Chinese groups, the ancestor veneration is one of the main forms of folk religion. However, a lot of Hakkas maintain the records of their ancestors meticulously. A lot of Hakka families can recount their genealogy going back 20 or 30 generations to the Song dynasty. Some of these records trace where and when the clan went from north to south during their migration.</li>
					<li>Cuisine: Because they needed a lot of energy to work in the fields, their meals tended to be hearty and heavy. Hakka food is known as salty, fragrant and umami. The conservation was done by salting or drying. The Hakka cuisine can be described as simple and pretty straightforward. As rice production is limited in the mountains, they use a lot of sweet potatoes, taro roots and yams.</li>
					<li>Art: Hakka hill songs are rural songs sung in the Hakka language. The farmers were singing as a mean of communication in hilly areas with a higher pitch so the sound could travel farther.</li>
					<li>Hakka women didn't bind their feet: the Hakkas were unusual among Han Chinese in not practising footbinding at all. Hakka women worked side by side with their men. They needed to have normal feet and good balance to work the fields, fish and fight: hakka women were warriors as well.</li>

		<h3 class="sectionsub">The Great Migration</h3>
		<p>We will now focus on the fifth big Hakka migration wave and try to explain in more depth the reasons behind it. China faced enormous crises during this period:</p>

			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>The population saw an exponential growth: by the mid-19th century, it reached 450 million (more than three times the level in 1500). The results were land shortages, famine, and an increasingly impoverished rural population. The farmer's situation was worsened by heavy taxes and inflation.</li>
				<li>The 1840-1842 Opium war launched by the British Empire was the beginning of the Century of humiliation. The war was easily won by the British. In 1842, China signed the treaty of Nanjing. This was the beginning of the long list of "Unequal treaties". China was subjugated by Western powers and then by Japan during a hundred years.</li>
				<li> Whereas China previously limited international trade and forbade ordinary Chinese to go overseas, the British now ordered China to open five strategic ports to foreign consuls, traders, and missionaries. In the context of Hakka migration, China was forced to allow its citizens to travel and work abroad.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="flex">
			<ul>
				<li>In 1851, Hong Xiuquan <span class="cc">洪秀全</span>, a Hakka Chinese Christian fundamentalist started a peasant uprising : the Taiping Rebellion. This turned into one of the deadliest armed conflicts in history, leaving 20-30 million dead. After 13 destructives years, the imperial armies ended the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with the help from French and British forces. As the key leaders of the Taiping Rebellion had all been Hakka, countless innocent Hakka families across China were randomly executed.</li>
				<li>1911 marks the end of imperial dynastic rule in China. China has been ruled by various dynasties for multiple thousands of years. The last one, the Qing dynasty was getting weaker and weaker. It has suffered at the hands of the West and the Japanese . There was growing discontent amonst the population. <br>The Qing dynasty have been overthrown in 1911 by the Wuchang Uprising. In 1912, the first Republic of China was established and the first provisional president was Sun Yat Sen.<br>The presidency was then bequeathed to Yuan Shikai who, in 1915, declared himself emperor. He abdicated and died a year later in 1916. This was the beginning of a period of extremely fragmented rule for China: the Warlord era. Each individual region was controlled by a different warlord who was in charge of a different military. In early 1920's, Sun Yat Sen went to Guangzhou, Guangdong, and set up a revolutionary governement to reestablish the Republic of China. He passed away in 1925 from cancer. The power of the movement he started called the Kuomintang passed on to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</li>

				<li>In 1927, the Chinese Civil War began as the Kuomintang from the South marched North to consolidate power of the warlords but also went after the Communist Party.</li>
				<li>While this is happening, in early 1930s, Japan once again is trying to exert its military might on the Chinese mainland and start to invade Manchuria.</li>
				<li>In 1937, the 2nd Sino-Japanese war is officialy declared. Communists and the Kuomintang worked together to push back the invader. The war created around 95 million refugees. However, after japan's defeat in 1945, the civil war was resumed.</li>
				<li>By 1949, the communists led by Mao Zedong, defeated Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. They were forced to retreat to Taiwan. They established a governement there and the Communist Party founded the People's Republic of China in mainland China. Several historians suggest the death toll for the entire Chinese Civil War period (1927-49) exceed 6 million.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>The country was ravaged by poverty, political changes and war. China saw a lot of its population leave their homeland. Hakkas specifically, always looking for better lands, massively migrated to countries such as Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, USA, Jamaica, Suriname but also in Mauritius and this is where we will continue our journey.</p>

			<<p>Mauritius is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2000 km off the southeast coast of Africa. The island has rich immigration history.</p>
			<p>The island has been Dutch, French, British and is now independent since 1968. </p>
			<p>During its French rule in 18th century, the laborers were slaves shipped over from mainland Africa. Later, in 1834 during its British rule, slavery has been abolished. A large immigration wave of workers from China and India ensued. Most of the Mauritians of Chinese origin are Hakka or Cantonese. Nowadays, we can list 4 main different ethnic groups in Mauritius: Indo-mauritians, Mauritian Creoles, Franco-mauritians and Sino-mauritians. Mauritius is a melting pot of cultures. Nowadays, every mauritian speak at least three languages: French, English and Creole.</p>

				<p>The first big wave of chinese immigrants in Mauritius was composed of traders and craftsmen from Fujian in late 18th century. </p>
				<p> They were followed from 1840 by the Cantonese (mainly from Nanhai and Shunde districts) and by the Hakkas (mainly from Meixian district), from 1860. It is important to note that the three different communities speak distinct dialects. </p>
				<p>At this time, the vast majority of of chinese immigrants settled down in Port-Louis, near the very active harbor : this was the birth of Chinatown.</p>
				<p>Most of them were shopkeepers and mainly sold everyday consumer products at retail. Chinese merchants have revolutionized commerce by allowing the purchase of food and clothing at retail. Until then, these products were only available from wholesalers and therefore beyond the reach of freedmen and workers who had just emerged from the hell of slavery. </p>
				</div>

		<div class="flex">
			<div>
			<p>One of the most significant figures in the history of Chinese immigration in Mauritius is undoubtedly Log Choisanne from Fujian. His role as protector and undisputed leader of the Chinese community gave him the title of "Kaptan", a name that still is a symbol for the Chinese trading community.</p>
			<p>He landed in Mauritius in 1816 where he established his first shop. Thanks to his mastery in French and English, he quickly succeeded. In 1821 Log Choisanne, with plans to open other stores in different districts of the capital, obtained the governor's authorization to seek other merchants in his native province of Fujian, whom he brought back at his own expense in 1826.</p>
			<p>Highly estimated by the British authorities, he became the official spokesperson and protector of Chinese immigrants. In 1842, he built the Kwan Tee <span class="cc">关帝</span> (or Guan Di) in honor of the god of war and protector of traders. As president of the pagoda, he was responsible for arbitrating disputes between Chinese immigrants and helping the poorest</p>
			<p>It is not only the first pagoda erected in Port-Louis but also one of the rare places of worship open to all members of the Chinese community regardless of their fujianese, cantonese or hakka origin. Beyond its function as a place of worship and Court of Justice, Kwan Tee was from the very start a place of unification. It is within that the first immigrants established a moral code inspired by Confucian thought which will maintain the cohesion of the community despite inter-ethnic rivalries and the beginning of conversions to Christianity.</p>

				<<p>"Laboutik sinoi", chinese shops in mauritian creole, quickly became a major player in the social and economic life of the country. They introduced a credit system so the workers could feed and clothe themselves during difficult times.</p>
				<p>In december 1908, based on the one in Shanghai created in 1906, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce (CCC) opened its doors. It works to provide support to the community. Indeed, even if in the 19th century, Mauritius was a better land of promise than China, the first generations of chinese immigrants had to face many difficulties when settling. Most of them didn't speak english or creole. The Chamber of Commerce acted as an intermediary between them and the English administration, helped them communicate and understand the laws governing trade and distribution in this country.</p>
				<p>Until 1945, the CCC issued passports and granted visas for the Chinese community. Its president was elected each year according to a rotation between Hakkas and Cantonese, in order to silence rivalries between ethnic groups and to build a solid sense of belonging to a single community. The CCC is still active nowadays and continues to organize, since 1918, a distribution of gifts to the most needy members of the community.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="flex">
				<div>
				<p>In Port-Louis Chinatown, an unparalleled solidarity was born between members of the Chinese community, more prescisely between members of the same clan : Lee <span class="cc">李</span> or Ng <span class="cc">吴</span> for example. This solidarity in the name of the clan is applied within the walls of the kwon <span class="cc">馆</span>. They are the pivots of the social life of newcomers as they provide assistance but are also the headquarters of each clan and most importantly are the place of mettings, offering lodging , food and distractions such as mah-jong games, cards or chess. </p>
				<p>As most kwon did not have a pagoda, small rooms with altars were set up to allow members to gather to seek the benevolent protection and blessing of ancestors or a deity. The Hakkas of all clans gathered together in the Heen Foh Lee Kwon society.</p>

				<p>Today, the sino-mauritian community in Mauritius represents only around 3% of the local population and more than half of them is based in Port-Louis. However, they have largely contributed to the emancipation of the local economy through trade. 25% of the top 100 companies in Mauritius are owned by Sino-Mauritians. The community have won the hearts of the island through their cultural practices, unique flavours and traditions. They also heavily influenced local cuisine. In the eyes of the general public on the island, sino-mauritians are very established, very integrated and very respected.</p>
				<p>Their cultural footprint can be seen around the island in the form of traditional pagodas, active cultural associations, and the vibrant Chinatown. The north and south entrances are marked by two gates, courtesy of Foshan city in Guangdong.</p>

				p>Before World War II, a lot of chinese immigrants sent their savings in China to help their families but also because they planned to return to their native land. Chinese people didn't have property rights and couldn't vote in Mauritius until 1947. Unfortunately, the civil war and japanese occupation discussed previously made them abandon their return plans. Chinese families used to send their boys in China to complete their chinese education. After that, they instead chose to give them a mauritian schooling before sending them pursue higher studies in Europe. Step by step, the children of immigrants mastered more French, English and Creole than their ancestral language.</p>
				<p>Over generations, sino-mauritians integrated themselves more and more into the general mauritian community, while still maintaining their ancestral traditions. The community freely intermingles, and increasingly intermarries with the country's Indian, Creole and other ethnic groups.</p>

			<p>My name is Benoît. I am french, live in France and I am 26 years old.</p>
			<p>I am actually half-Hakka, my mother is French. Due to family problems, I mostly grew up without my paternal side of the family. </p>
			<p>Until last year, I didn't know anything at all about the Hakkas nor the Chinese culture in general. I started some genealogical research to know more about my origins and also to find my family that I didn't see since I was a baby. I met online some amazing people who helped me find out everything.</p>
			<p>After not seeing them for 22 years, I was finally able to meet my uncles and aunts in Mauritius during a trip with my wife.</p>
			<p>Other than that, I work in the pharmaceutic field. My wife is Turkish and I also find the Turkish culture fascinating.</p>
			<p>I love to travel, asian food, videogames, web culture and I think I can now say that I like to create webpages.</p>
			<p>I speak french, english, a bit of spanish and turkish. I'm also currently learning mandarin and hakka.
			<p>One of my passions is to learn new things. I always try to dig deeper when I discover something new. I'm also conviced that there is always something to learn from other people. We should stop arguing and instead listen and learn from each other.</p>
